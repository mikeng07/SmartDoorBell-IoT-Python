# Smart Doorbell IoT Project

## Overview
I developed a smart doorbell IoT device using a Raspberry Pi, which captures an image when the doorbell is pressed and sends it to the owner's cellphone via Twilio. This project showcases skills in IoT development, Python programming, API integration, and 3D design.

## Key Features
- Image capture triggered by doorbell press
- Real-time image transmission to owner's cellphone
- Custom 3D-printed enclosure designed in SolidWorks

## Technical Details
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi
- Programming Language: Python
- API Integration: Twilio for image transmission
- 3D Design: SolidWorks
- Manufacturing: 3D printing

## Project Highlights
